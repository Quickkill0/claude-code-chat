# Task: Agent Management UI Modal

## Task Status
Current: Completed

## Problem Statement
Create a comprehensive UI modal system that allows users to Create, Modify, and Delete agents in both local and user scopes through a graphical interface, eliminating the need for CLI interactions.

## Context & Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Claude Code chat panel interface
- Follow existing modal patterns (MCP, Settings) for consistency
- Support both local (.claude/agents/) and user (~/.claude/agents/) scope management
- Maintain YAML frontmatter format for agent files
- Include AI-powered agent generation using Claude
- Support export/import functionality for agent sharing

## Expected Outcome
- An "Agents" button in the chat panel (styled like MCP button) that opens an agent management modal
- Full CRUD operations for agents in both local and user scopes
- Two creation methods: manual form and AI-assisted generation
- Clone functionality between scopes
- Export/import capabilities for agent sharing
- Color coding system for visual agent identification
- Seamless integration with existing Claude Code agent system

## Task Type
Full-stack

## Technical Context
### Code Constraints
- Follow TypeScript strict mode requirements (ES2022 target)
- Use camelCase/PascalCase naming conventions
- Semicolons required in TypeScript/JavaScript
- Maintain VS Code webview security constraints (CSP)
- Use existing message passing patterns for webview communication

### Architecture Hints
- Leverage reverted AgentManager implementation in out/AgentManager.js
- Follow existing modal patterns from MCP implementation (ui.ts:202-330)
- Use existing SessionManager for AI agent generation
- Reuse webview message handling patterns from extension.ts
- Follow existing button styling from tools-btn class

### Tech Stack Requirements
- TypeScript 5.8.3 for type safety
- js-yaml for YAML frontmatter parsing
- VS Code Extension API for file operations
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for webview interface
- Node.js fs.promises for file system operations

### API Constraints
- Use vscode.postMessage() for extension-webview communication
- Respect VS Code Content Security Policy in webview
- File operations limited to workspace and user home directory
- Follow existing message handler patterns (e.g., 'getMCPServers', 'saveMCPServer')

## Code Guidance
### File Organization
- src/AgentManager.ts - Backend agent management logic
- src/ui.ts - Add agent modal HTML structure
- src/ui-styles.ts - Add agent modal CSS styling
- src/script.ts - Add client-side agent handlers
- src/extension.ts - Add message handlers for agent operations

### Testing Requirements
- No automated testing required (user will perform testing)
- Ensure error handling for file operations
- Validate YAML frontmatter format
- Handle missing directories gracefully

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load agent list when modal opens
- Cache agent metadata for quick display
- Debounce search functionality
- Efficient file operations using async/await

## Missions
- [x] Mission 1: Backend - Implement AgentManager class with full CRUD operations for both scopes
- [x] Mission 2: Backend - Add message handlers in extension.ts for agent operations and AI generation
- [x] Mission 3: Frontend - Create agent modal UI structure in ui.ts with button integration
- [x] Mission 4: Frontend - Add CSS styling in ui-styles.ts matching existing modal patterns
- [x] Mission 5: Frontend - Implement client-side JavaScript handlers in script.ts
- [x] Mission 6: Full-stack - Add export/import functionality with file picker integration
- [x] Mission 7: Full-stack - Integrate AI-powered agent generation with SessionManager
- [x] Mission 8: Full-stack - Final testing and polish with error handling

## Agent Usage Tracking
*Agents used across all missions will be tracked here*

### Mission 1 Agents
- No agents used - implemented directly based on reverted code from commit b339bba

### Mission 2 Agents
- No agents used - implemented message handlers directly based on existing patterns

### Mission 3 Agents
- No agents used - created UI structure following existing modal patterns

### Mission 4 Agents
- No agents used - added comprehensive CSS styling following existing patterns

### Mission 5 Agents
- No agents used - implemented comprehensive JavaScript handlers for all agent operations

### Mission 6 Agents
- No agents used - export/import already implemented in AgentManager and extension.ts

### Mission 7 Agents
- No agents used - AI generation already integrated in extension.ts handlers

### Mission 8 Agents
- No agents used - comprehensive error handling already added throughout all components

## Notes
- Task created: 2025-09-23
- Status: Brainstormed → Validated → In dev → Testing → Completed
- All missions defined upfront based on problem analysis
- Each mission builds incrementally on previous ones
- Agent outputs tracked for context window optimization
- Leveraging reverted code from commit b339bba as reference
