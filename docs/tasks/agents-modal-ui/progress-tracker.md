# Task: Agents Modal UI

## Task Status
Current: Completed with Enhancements (2025-09-23)

## Problem Statement
Create a UI modal that allows users to Create, Modify, and Delete AI agents in both local and user scopes. Add an "Agents" button to the right of the MCP button in the chat panel that opens a modal showing agents from both scopes with full CRUD capabilities through a GUI interface.

## Context & Constraints
- Follow existing modal patterns from MCP and Settings modals
- Use vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS (no frameworks)
- Integrate with existing `.claude/agents/` directory structure
- Support both local (project) and user (global) agent scopes
- Maintain VS Code theme compatibility
- Follow existing file organization and naming conventions

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional agents modal that:
- Shows all available agents from both local and user scopes
- Allows creating new agents with form-based UI
- Enables editing existing agent files
- Provides safe deletion with confirmation
- Integrates seamlessly with the existing chat panel UI

## Task Type
Full-stack

## Technical Context
### Code Constraints
- Follow kebab-case for CSS classes and file names
- Use camelCase for JavaScript functions and IDs
- Maintain monolithic structure (HTML in ui.ts, CSS in ui-styles.ts, JS in script.ts)
- Use VS Code CSS variables for theming
- Modal structure must follow `.tools-modal` pattern

### Architecture Hints
- Modal pattern: Fixed overlay with `.tools-modal` class
- Button placement: After MCP button in chat panel (ui.ts ~line 172)
- State management: Global JavaScript variables in script.ts
- Backend communication: vscode.postMessage() pattern
- File operations: Use fs.promises for agent file CRUD

### Tech Stack Requirements
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- VS Code Extension API
- TypeScript for backend logic
- CSS-in-JS pattern (ui-styles.ts)
- Node.js fs module for file operations

### API Constraints
- Message handlers in extension.ts
- Use existing webview communication patterns
- Agent file format: Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Directory paths: `.claude/agents/` (local) and `~/.claude/agents/` (user)

## Code Guidance
### File Organization
- Modal HTML: src/ui.ts (after MCP modal ~line 650)
- Modal CSS: src/ui-styles.ts (with other modal styles)
- JavaScript logic: src/script.ts
- Backend handlers: src/extension.ts or new AgentManager class
- Agent files: .claude/agents/*.md

### Testing Requirements
- Test agent CRUD operations
- Verify modal show/hide functionality
- Validate YAML frontmatter parsing
- Test file system operations with error handling
- Ensure proper scope separation (local vs user)

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load agent content only when needed
- Cache agent metadata to avoid repeated file reads
- Debounce search/filter operations
- Use virtual scrolling for large agent lists if needed

## Missions
- [x] Mission 1: Backend - Create AgentManager class with CRUD operations for agent files in both scopes
- [x] Mission 2: Backend - Add message handlers in extension.ts for agent operations (list, create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Mission 3: Frontend - Add Agents button to chat panel and create modal HTML structure
- [x] Mission 4: Frontend - Implement modal show/hide logic and basic agent listing display
- [x] Mission 5: Frontend - Create agent creation form with fields for name, description, model, color, and system prompt
- [x] Mission 6: Frontend - Add agent editing capability (without syntax highlighting for now)
- [x] Mission 7: Frontend - Implement agent deletion with confirmation dialog
- [x] Mission 8: Frontend - Add search/filter functionality and scope toggle (local/user/both)
- [x] Mission 9: Full-stack - Integrate frontend with backend handlers and test complete CRUD flow
- [x] Mission 10: Full-stack - Add error handling, validation, and user feedback messages

## Notes
- Task created: 2025-09-23
- Status: Brainstormed → Validated → In dev → Testing → Completed
- All missions defined upfront based on project analysis
- Backend-first approach to establish data layer before UI
- Each mission builds incrementally on previous ones
- Agent outputs tracked for context window optimization

## Post-Completion Enhancements (2025-09-23)

### Issues Identified and Fixed:
1. **Clone Agent Scope Selection Issue**
   - **Problem**: When cloning an agent, users couldn't select a different scope than the original
   - **Solution**: Modified clone functionality to allow any scope selection, defaulting to 'local'
   - **Files Modified**: src/script.ts (line 3302)

2. **Limited Color Options**
   - **Problem**: Only 4 colors were available (blue, green, red, cyan)
   - **Solution**: Expanded to all 8 Claude Code supported colors
   - **Colors Added**: yellow, purple, orange, pink
   - **Files Modified**:
     - src/ui.ts - Added all 8 color options to dropdown
     - src/AgentManager.ts - Updated TypeScript types
     - src/ui-styles.ts - Added CSS styles for new colors

3. **AI-Powered Agent Generation**
   - **Problem**: No AI assistance for creating agents
   - **Solution**: Implemented Claude-powered agent generation
   - **Features Added**:
     - "Generate with AI" button as primary action
     - New modal for describing desired agent
     - Claude generates name, description, model, color, and system prompt
     - Generated agent auto-populates create form for review
   - **Files Modified**:
     - src/ui.ts - Added generation modal UI
     - src/script.ts - Added generation handlers
     - src/extension.ts - Implemented _generateAgent method using SessionManager

4. **Agent Generation Not Using Real AI**
   - **Problem**: Initial implementation used templates, not actual Claude
   - **Solution**: Properly integrated with Claude CLI through SessionManager
   - **Implementation**:
     - Uses same process creation as regular chat
     - Sends structured prompt to Claude
     - Parses JSON response from Claude's streaming output
     - Validates and sanitizes generated data
   - **Files Modified**: src/extension.ts (_generateAgent method)

### Technical Improvements:
- **Color System**: Now supports full color palette with proper RGBA values
- **Agent Generation**: Real-time AI generation with proper error handling
- **User Experience**: Seamless flow from idea to agent creation
- **Code Quality**: Maintained consistency with existing patterns

### Final Feature Set:
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for agents
- ✅ Local and user scope support
- ✅ 8 color options for agent identification
- ✅ AI-powered agent generation
- ✅ Manual agent creation option
- ✅ Clone agents between scopes
- ✅ Search and filter functionality
