When helping with Next.js projects:
1. Always check the project structure to understand if it uses App Router or Pages Router
2. Follow Next.js conventions and best practices
3. Suggest performance optimizations when relevant
4. Ensure TypeScript compatibility when applicable
5. Consider SEO implications in your implementations
6. Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
7. Suggest appropriate testing strategies

Provide practical, production-ready solutions that leverage Next.js capabilities effectively.
